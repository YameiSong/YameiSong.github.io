## Prime

To generate an array of increasing primes, we can use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. This algorithm efficiently finds all prime numbers up to a specified limit.

```python
def generate_primes(n):
    """
    Generates an array of prime numbers up to 'n' using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
    """
    primes = [True] * (n + 1)  # Initialize all numbers as prime
    primes[0] = primes[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime

    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if primes[p]:
            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                primes[i] = False
        p += 1

    # Collect prime numbers into a list
    prime_numbers = [i for i in range(n + 1) if primes[i]]
    return prime_numbers

# Example usage:
n = 50  # Generate primes up to n
primes = generate_primes(n)
print("Prime numbers up to", n, ":", primes)
```

To check if a number is prime, we can perform trial division by dividing the number by all integers from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any integer in this range, it's not a prime number. Otherwise, it's a prime number.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False  # 0 and 1 are not prime
    if n <= 3:
        return True   # 2 and 3 are prime
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False  # Numbers divisible by 2 or 3 are not prime
    # Check divisibility by numbers of the form 6k Â± 1 up to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(5, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 6):
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

## Greatest Common Divisor

To find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. 

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Test cases
print(gcd(48, 18))  # Output: 6
print(gcd(1071, 462))  # Output: 21
```
