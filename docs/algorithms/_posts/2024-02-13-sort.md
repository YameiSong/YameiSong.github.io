## Counting Sort

Counting sort is a non-comparison based sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of occurrences of each distinct element in the input array and using arithmetic to determine the positions of each element in the output array.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Counting Frequencies**: Count the occurrences of each distinct element in the input array and store the counts in an auxiliary array called the "count" array. The count array's size is typically determined by the range of input values.

2. **Accumulating Counts**: Modify the count array so that each element at index `i` represents the number of elements less than or equal to `i` in the input array.

3. **Building the Output Array**: Iterate through the input array. For each element `arr[i]`, use the count array to determine its position in the output array. After placing an element in the output array, decrement its count in the count array.

### Time Complexity:

Counting sort is efficient when *the range of input values is not significantly greater than the number of elements to be sorted*. It runs in linear time complexity \(O(n + k)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array and \(k\) is the range of input values.

### Python Implementation:

```python
def counting_sort(arr):
    max_element = max(arr)
    count = [0] * (max_element + 1)
    
    # Count the occurrences of each element
    for element in arr:
        count[element] += 1
    
    # Build the sorted output array
    sorted_arr = []
    for i in range(len(count)):
        sorted_arr.extend([i] * count[i])
    
    return sorted_arr

# Example usage:
arr = [4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", counting_sort(arr))
```

This implementation demonstrates the basic steps of counting sort: counting frequencies, accumulating counts, and building the sorted output array.
